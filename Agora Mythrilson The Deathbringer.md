###### Agora was born in Midgard and travelled to Meijin in 2036 when she was 20 after she got a job at the [[Bradfordn't Royal Academy]]. When she first arrived she was working under her mentor "[[Andala The Red Lady]]". However, in 2038 Andala joined a scouting party to attempt to scout the first zone with the 38th zone mission. Because in the fifteen years since [[The Gate]] first opened nobody had been able to get further than 2 Kilocubits into the first zone. This was because of the [[cereflux]] who resided within the first zone, named so due to the unique way these natives kill.
