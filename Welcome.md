# This Vault is Holly's design vault for the woodland a DnD inspired VRARPG with dating sim elements which can alter the flow of the ingame story.

## The first game design element that I intend to work on is the procedural magic/crafting system (I got the idea for this from the anime "Infinite Dendrogram")
### The system is made up of 4 parts namely the [[Spellcraft]] system which uses rune graphs to create spells; the [[Potioncraft]] system which uses hundreds of different ingredients (some based on real life cultural medicine too) to produce potions; the [[Magic Item Crafting system]] which is used to produce magic weapons and other items to be used in gameplay and the [[Non-Magic Item Crafting system]]
