###### The cereflux are a race of sentient hivemind creatures appearing as some where between an insect and a squid. They called the cereflux as they kill by liquefying the cerebellum of their victims to paralyze them, using the victim as an incubator for their eggs. While this is happening the victim is always still alive  and the cereflux feeds upon the negative emotions of the victim.
